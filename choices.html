      <h2>Choices</h2>
      <p>
        The emergence of artificial intelligence in art presents us with a wide
        range of possibilities, but it also presents artists, developers and
        society with a wide range of important choices. These choices are
        critical to navigating AI art's opportunities and challenges. This
        section explores some of the key choices surrounding AI art, examining
        ethical considerations, transparency and accountability, automation and
        human involvement, societal impact, and the role of education and
        awareness. By examining these aspects, we understand the choices
        available to individuals, organizations, and society. We also understand
        how they shape the world of AI art and its integration into our creative
        landscape.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Ethics is an essential aspect of AI art, with developers making
        deliberate choices that address ethical issues. One key choice involves
        reducing bias and discrimination in AI algorithms that generate art. As
        Damien Patrick Williams (2022) argues, the choices chosen during AI art
        development can have a profound effect on its ethical implications.
        Damien Patrick Williams had researched and found the bias and prejudices
        within AI art that was being generated due to the datasets. By selecting
        various and inclusive datasets and utilizing bias-checking tools,
        developers have the choice of stopping the perpetuation of societal
        biases in artwork created by AI. Bias and discrimination in AI-generated
        art is not only a moral issue, but it also influences the quality and
        societal impact of the artwork. By accepting different perspectives on
        AI-generated art it provides a more realistic representation of human
        experiences and encourages creativity. Making choices to address bias
        and discrimination ensures AI art positively contributes to society.
        This choice emphasises fairness and openness, ensuring that AI art's
        ethical implications are consistent with societal norms and forms a more
        open artistic landscape. Ultimately, developers are faced with crucial
        choices regarding ethical considerations such as bias and discrimination
        that contribute to a more inclusive and responsible AI art environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Another crucial ethical choice in AI art is around copyright, ownership
        and attribution. Artists and developers face the challenge of protecting
        intellectual property rights and ensuring they are properly acknowledged
        and paid for AI-created art. In AI art, ownership is complicated due to
        AI algorithms' role in the creative process. AI art is created by
        combining information gathered over time, so there isn't just one artist
        for a generated AI art piece. Joanna Zylinska (2020) has proposed that
        by choosing to honour artists' rights, a sustainable atmosphere can be
        sustained where creative endeavours are rewarded and creative ideas are
        embraced to enable AI-created art to thrive. By establishing clear
        boundaries and licensing procedures, artists and developers can navigate
        the complex AI art ownership landscape. These choices affect other
        artists as well as the prospect of AI art, as they form how people view
        and accept AI-generated artwork in the traditional art world. By making
        choices that acknowledge copyright, ownership and giving credit where
        due, creators and developers can shape the AI art community to ensure
        fairness and morality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        The choices around transparency in AI art are extremely important. By
        choosing to make the decision-making process visible and understandable,
        developers and artists can understand how AI systems create art. This
        choice allows people to gain insights into the creative process and
        fosters more appreciation for the collaboration between human creativity
        and machine intelligence. Transparent algorithms would help counteract
        potential issues such as biases, discrimination and opacity in
        AI-generated art. Kate Crawford (2017), a prominent AI ethics
        researcher, emphasizes the need for transparency in AI art algorithms.
        She states that by making the decision-making process public, artists
        and developers can create a more equitable and responsible environment
        as people can examine and identify any biases that may arise allowing
        for necessary adjustments. These choices around transparency encourage
        creativity and cooperation between developers and artists. It
        establishes trust within the art community and welcomes AI art into the
        art world with the assurance of ethical standards and social values
        being followed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Automation and Human Involvement</h2>
      <p>
        AI-generated art involves major choices about how much automation and
        human involvement should be utilized in the creative process. Although
        algorithms can create artwork independently, artists and developers can
        give input to ensure creative control and uphold artistic authenticity.
        According to Jon McCormack (2019)'s paper, human involvement is
        essential as it preserves artistic vision and intention. By choosing to
        collaborate with AI algorithms as creative tools, artists can harness
        their computational abilities while bringing their own distinct
        viewpoints and aesthetic sensibilities to the final artwork. By making
        this choice, artists can maintain a sense of authorship and give their
        work its unique creative voice, ensuring that it reflects their own
        aesthetic vision. Collaborating with AI algorithms as creative tools
        preserves the artist's role in shaping a piece of artwork. This causes
        the art world to evolve and incorporate AI into art.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Societal Impact and Education</h2>
      <p>
        In AI art, choices are important to determine how they will affect
        society and respect ethical norms. Developers can make deliberate
        choices that allow AI art to steer towards positive societal outcomes.
        This is done by addressing urgent issues and avoiding biases and
        injustices. As Tracy Harwood (2019) states "Art enhances both physical
        and mental health wellbeing" which shows the impacts of art on people.
        Artists can choose to bring attention to concerns like environmental
        preservation, social justice, or mental health by using AI art as a
        powerful platform for social commentary and activism which positively
        contributes to societal change. Simultaneously, choices can be taken to
        emphasise education and increase public understanding of the benefits,
        issues and ethical implications of AI art among artists, developers and
        the general public. Through the provision of materials, workshops, and
        discussion forums, artists and organizations can help people make
        informed choices in the field of AI art. By having a greater
        understanding of AI art it encourages critical and thoughtful engagement
        with AI art, ensuring that choices align with ethical considerations and
        societal values. According to Selin Akgun and Christine Greenhow (2021)
        education and awareness are the foundation of responsible behaviour and
        the development of an ethical environment for AI art. The landscape of
        AI art can be collectively shaped by artists, developers and
        organisations to be a force for good change, one that is in line with
        ethical principles and benefits the larger community by making conscious
        decisions that prioritise societal impact, education and responsible
        engagement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, the choices surrounding AI art are crucial in shaping its
        impact on the artistic community and society as a whole. We can properly
        manage AI art complexity by using transparent and responsible
        algorithms, addressing ethical issues, striking a balance between
        automation and human involvement, addressing social impact, and
        promoting education and awareness. By making these choices, we can
        ensure fairness, diversity, and moral behaviour while maximising the
        potential of AI art to inspire, engage, and contribute to the cultural
        fabric. This leads to being advantageous to artists, audiences and
        society by actively participating in AI art decisions.
