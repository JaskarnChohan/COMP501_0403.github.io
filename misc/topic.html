  <h3 class="section-heading">What is AI?</h3>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science which aims to create machine algorithms that emulate human intelligence to perform human tasks. The most popular ways of developing AI are through the concepts of machine and deep learning which has allowed AI to progress much further. AI is modelled after the human mind and so naturally, they aim to assist in and even replace some aspects of human life. In this case, we are dealing with AI in the world of the visual arts.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">What are AI Art Generators?</h3>
  <p>AI Art Generators have been blowing up in popularity as of recent due to the rapidly increasing quality of art that it generates. AI models like MIdjourney, Stable Diffusion and Dall-E are among the most popular ones. AI art generators follow a text-to-image model where a user types in prompts like “man holding a bag” or “renaissance painting of a dog” and the AI model will generate an image that fits those prompts. This is possible since most AI models are trained off of massive data sets of annotated images and artworks. The AI program learns from what its seen and produces images based on what it knows. AI art generators are most popularly used for generating paintings, photographs, anime-style artworks etc.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Why we chose this topic:</h3>
  <p>We chose this topic because this technology has big implications on the future of not just the visual arts but also any other creative industries like writing, music, and film. Its use as a tool could make art more accessible and could lessen the workload on artists and designers. However, it’s also important that we explore its flaws too. There are easy-to-fix issues like bias and discrimination in the datasets, and there are harder ethical issues regarding the uncertainty of who legally owns an AI generated image. These problems need to be ironed out before the people and companies start using these technologies ethically in everyday life.</p>
