It is built on a W3C site tutorial so does not claim to be flash, but now has an image, [of a paper we wrote a while back on CSED4G (Computing Education for the Social Good)]</p>

	<div class="info2">
	<p>The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can be regarded as a "minimum viable product" for the purposes of this projectâ€¦ It has some default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure. The Process Support Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project.</p><img src="images/AI-2.jpeg" alt="Photo of AI" class="photo-2">
